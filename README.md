# Futbol 5

Very basic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) app for managing weekly soccer matches.

Basically, it just creates matches every week and emails a join link to players.

Based on the [Futbol 5 Rails app](https://github.com/irodrigo17/fulbol5).

## TODOs

- [ ] Create CRON Job to create matches and send emails.
- [ ] Create basic match view
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Integrate [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
